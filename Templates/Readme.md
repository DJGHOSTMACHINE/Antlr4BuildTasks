# Antlr4BuildTasks.Templates

This directory contains code for Antlr templates for Net Core. So far the only template it
contains is a "Hello World" console app for Antlr4. You will need to download Java, and the ANTLR 4.8
Java jar. See [Installation of Prerequisites](https://github.com/kaby76/Antlr4BuildTasks#installation-of-prerequisites)
for full details.

## To install:

    dotnet new -i Antlr4BuildTasks.Templates

Note, if you are working from a cloned local copy,
you need to use the full path of the "AntlrCAProject" directory.
(The dotnet tool always gives "Usage: new [options]"
in the output even if the command succeeds, so you don't know if the
command worked or not,
and [the instructions in poor English](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates#installing-a-template).)

    dotnet new -i <absolute-path-to-AntlrCAProject>

e.g.,

    dotnet new -i C:\Users\kenne\Documents\Antlr4BuildTasks\Templates\templates\AntlrCAProject'


## To create an Antlr C# program:

    mkdir Foo
    cd Foo
    dotnet new antlr
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    dotnet run

## To uninstall:

    dotnet new -u Antlr4BuildTasks.Templates

Note, if you are working from a cloned local copy,
you need to use the full path of the "AntlrCAProject" directory.

    dotnet new -u <absolute-path-to-AntlrCAProject>

e.g.,

    dotnet new -u C:\Users\kenne\Documents\Antlr4BuildTasks\Templates\templates\AntlrCAProject'
