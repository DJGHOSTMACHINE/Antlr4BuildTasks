# Antlr4BuildTasks

This is a modification of Hartwell's [Antlr4cs](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs),
containing only the Antlr4 Task wrapper program, which is needed by Msbuild.
This project is for VS2017, Antlr4 grammars, and requires the Antlr4 Java tool to be installed. Otherwise, much of the information is the same as
with the Antlr4cs project.
