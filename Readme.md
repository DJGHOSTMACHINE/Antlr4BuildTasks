# Antlr4BuildTasks

This is a modification of Hartwell's [Antlr4cs](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs),
containing only the Antlr4 Task wrapper program, which is needed by Msbuild. All else is removed
so it can use whatever Antlr tool chain. It is only a Net Standard assembly, so backwards compatibility is
restricted. It requires the offical Antlr4 Java tool to be installed.
This project is for VS2017, Antlr4 grammars only.
